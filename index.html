                            Stephen Bowen has successfully transitioned from one of the premier Defensive Linemen in professional football to the Head of Game Initiatives of the National Football League. After spending five seasons with the Dallas Cowboys and four seasons with the Washington Redskins (and helping them become NFC East Champions as a team captain), Stephen finished his playing career with the New York Jets. Stephen graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies from Hofstra University and a Masters of Business Administration from the George Washington University.

                            Tiffany Bowen wears many hats including running a popular NYC restaurant and lounge and supporting several philanthropic initiatives. She also sits on the board of directors for the New York City Hospitality Alliance and is the treasurer of the National Restaurant and Bar Association. Tiffany received her Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from Hofstra University, Masters of Arts in Teaching from the University of Southern California, Masters of Business Administration from the George Washington University and Doctorate of Education from the University of Southern California.

                            Stephen and Tiffany found Skyler’s Gift Foundation in 2011 after the loss of their son Skyler to prematurity related causes. Skyler’s Gift pays for burial and cremation cost for families who have lost their premature infants, as well as grief counseling. Stephen and Tiffany served as Ambassadors for the March of Dimes- National Chapter in 2012 and 2013. Together the Bowen’s have raised hundreds of thousands for infant health research and familial bereavement services. Stephen and Tiffany’s greatest joy are their three children, Trinity, Stephen III, and Skyler.
